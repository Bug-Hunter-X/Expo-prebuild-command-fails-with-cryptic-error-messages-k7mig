// This file demonstrates how to debug the Expo prebuild issue.

// 1. Detailed Logging (Example for Android): 
// Modify your android/app/build.gradle to increase logging verbosity during the native build process.
//  e.g., adding more logging within your custom native modules if applicable.

// 2. Dependency Analysis: 
// Carefully review your package.json, looking for conflicting dependencies and ensuring all native modules are compatible.
// You might use npm-check-updates to find outdated packages which may be causing the problem.

// 3. Configuration Review (Example):
// Check your app.json to ensure that the correct settings are present and the SDK version is appropriate.

// 4. Clean and Rebuild:
// Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clean the build artifacts and try again.

// 5. Minimal Reproducible Example (Illustrative):
// Create a new Expo project with minimal dependencies and gradually add the modules involved in the error to isolate the problematic module.

// 6. Community Support:
// Search for the error message in Expo's documentation, community forums, and Github issues to see if there are any known solutions.
