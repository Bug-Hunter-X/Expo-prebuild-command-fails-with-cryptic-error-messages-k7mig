# Expo prebuild Failure with Unclear Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo `expo prebuild` command fails with unclear error messages.  The primary challenge is diagnosing the root cause due to the lack of specific error details in the native build process. This example highlights potential issues and strategies for debugging.

## Problem:

The `expo prebuild` command unexpectedly fails during the native build phase, providing minimal information about the source of the error.  This makes identifying and fixing the problem difficult.

## Solution:

The solution involves a systematic approach to troubleshooting:

1. **Detailed Logging:** Enable verbose logging for the native build process to increase the chances of uncovering more information.  For Android, this may involve modifying build.gradle files. For iOS, check Xcode build logs.
2. **Dependency Analysis:** Carefully review the project's dependencies, checking for conflicts between Expo modules or compatibility issues with native libraries.
3. **Configuration Review:** Verify the correctness of your `app.json`, `android/app/build.gradle`, and `ios/Podfile` (for iOS).  Ensure that all necessary configurations, especially regarding native modules, are properly set.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the build cache and performing a fresh build to eliminate any lingering artifacts from previous attempts.
5. **Minimal Reproducible Example:**  Create a minimal project that reproduces the issue to isolate the problem from other code elements.  This can make debugging significantly simpler.
6. **Community Support:** Leverage Expo's community forums, documentation, and issue tracker to search for similar problems and potential solutions.
