This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command, especially when dealing with complex projects or custom native modules.  It often manifests as a cryptic error message within the native build process (Android or iOS), offering little insight into the root cause.  The underlying issue can vary, from problems with native dependencies, incorrect configurations in your `app.json` or `android/app/build.gradle` files, to conflicts between Expo modules or versions.
